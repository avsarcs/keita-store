# keita-store
This is the front-end for the product listings of a hypothethical store named Keita.

# How to Use
Run index.html on any supported browser. To start, click the New Listing button and enter product details. Make sure that the thumbnail you upload has a reasonable size (~<2MB) since most browsers put a limit on how much data can be stored in session storage. Click "List Your Product!" and see your listing appear on the front page as it is appended to the other product cards.

# Technologies
CSS, SCSS, DOM Manipulation, Session Storage and Flex are taken advantage of alongside regular client-side Javascript.
